number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100) # storing it in a variable to generate a number between 1 and 100
Note: Always use descriptice names for your variables, 
don't use names like A or X because someone else reading your code will have no clue what these variables represent

old:
user_input = input('Guess the number between 1 and 100:') #Now we should convert this to a number so next line does that
guess = int(user_input)

new:
guess = int(input('Guess the number between 1 and 100: ')) # the old has unnecessary code that can be just one line of code
print(guess)

This error under is what you would get if you would type a letter instead of a number till now then.

File "c:\dev\python projects\number guessing game\number_guessing_game.py", line 5, in <module>
    guess = int(input('Guess the number between 1 and 100: '))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'a'

So we have to add a try line inside the block

try:
    guess = int(input('Guess the number between 1 and 100: '))
except ValueError:
    print('Please enter a valid number')
Now it would ask Please enter a valid number if you give it a letter.

Then we will add in the try block
if guess < number_to_guess:
        print("Too low!")
    elif guess > number_to_guess:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        print("Good job! You guessed the number.")

Add a loop above try and a break at the end of the good job string. So you can break out of the loop.
