user_choice = input("Rock, paper or scissors? (r/p/s)"). lower()
after the line above we should validate the choice, like in a previous project we are going to call the lower method
so the text will only be lowercase text

if user_choice != "r" and user_choice != "p" and user_choice != "s":
    print("Invalid choice!")

!= means does NOT equal

BUT this is not a very cleaver/professional way to implement this.
We can store the list of valid choices in a list then check to see if the user's choice is in that list or not.

choices = ["r", "p", "s"]
user_choice = input("Rock, paper or scissors? (r/p/s)"). lower()
if user_choice not in choices:
    print("Invalid choice!")

This code above is more concise and elegant
choices = ["r", "p", "s"] but if you convert this line to the one under, because lists can be modified in the program with append or remove like choice.remove ("r")
choices = ("r", "p", "s")
then it becomes read only 

random.choice() with this we can pass a list or a top hole like choices and let the computer choose one of the valid choices.

f string stands for formatted.

in python we have a data structure called a dictionary
a dictionary is used to map a key to a value
# key -> value
so we can map the character R to the emoji of a Rock
# "r" -> "🗿"

to declare a dictionary you do:
emojis = { "r": "🗿", "s":✂️, "p":📃}

So the code now looks like this:
emojis = { "r": "🗿", "s": "✂️", "p": "📃"}
choices = ("r", "p", "s")
user_choice = input("Rock, paper or scissors? (r/p/s): "). lower()
if user_choice not in choices:
    print("Invalid choice!")
 
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)
print(f"You chose {emojis[user_choice]}")
print(f"Computer chose {emojis[user_choice]}")

and now for dertemeting the winner 

if user_choice == computer_choice:
    print("Tie!")
elif (
    (user_choice == "r" and computer_choice == "s") or 
    (user_choice == "s" and computer_choice == "p") or 
    (user_choice == "p" and computer_choice == "r")):
    print("You Win!")
else:
    print("You Lose!")

    should_continue = input("Continue (y/n)").lower() 
    At this line you can't use continue because CONTINUE is a reserved keyword in Python

    print("Invalid choice!")
        continue
    and at this line we added continue for if you type a different letter than r,s,p you don't get an error.
