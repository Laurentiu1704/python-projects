user_choice = input("Rock, paper or scissors? (r/p/s): "). lower()
    if user_choice not in choices:
        print("Invalid choice!")
        continue
These lines have a single responsibility.
So we can put it all into one seperate function called user choice

def get_user_choice(user_choice, computer_choice):
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Rock, paper or scissors? (r/p/s): "). lower()
        if user_choice in choices:
            return user_choice
        else:
            print("Invalid choice!")

and now for another function for the
    print(f"You chose {emojis[user_choice]}")
    print(f"Computer chose {emojis[computer_choice]}")

called: 
def display_choices(user_choice, computer_choice):
    
    print(f"You chose {emojis[user_choice]}")
    print(f"Computer chose {emojis[computer_choice]}")

and also for determining the winner function:
def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        print("Tie!")
    elif (
        (user_choice == "r" and computer_choice == "s") or 
        (user_choice == "s" and computer_choice == "p") or 
        (user_choice == "p" and computer_choice == "r")):
        print("You Win!")
    else:
        print("You Lose!")

You can also do this with the whole loop logic.
def play_game():
    while True:
        user_choice = get_user_choice()
        
        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

        display_choices(user_choice, computer_choice)

        determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)

        should_continue = input("Continue (y/n)").lower()
        if should_continue == "n":
            break
        
And at the end: play_game() So we can run the game
