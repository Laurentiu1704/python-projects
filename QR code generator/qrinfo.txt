It is good practice to remove any white spaces around what the user types, for example:
"https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/"
"https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/ "
If a user types it with a white space or without it we still want to have the same QR code generator.
So the .strip() method gets rid of any white spaces around our data and filename.


import qrcode

data = input("Enter the text or URL: ").strip()
filename = input("Enter the filename: ").strip()


Next call data and pass data

type(img)  # qrcode.image.pil.PilImage
   - type() is a built-in Python function that returns the data type of an object
   - In this case, it tells us that 'img' is a PilImage object
   - The comment "# qrcode.image.pil.PilImage" shows the expected result
   - This is just for reference/documentation; the line doesn't affect your code
   - You can delete this line if you don't need it

img.save(filename + ".png")
   - .save() is a method that writes the QR code image to your computer
   - filename + ".png" combines the user's filename with the .png extension
   - Example: if user enters "mycode", this saves it as "mycode.png"
   - The file is created in the same folder where your script is running
