It is good practice to remove any white spaces around what the user types, for example:
"https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/"
"https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/ "
If a user types it with a white space or without it we still want to have the same QR code generator.
So the .strip() method gets rid of any white spaces around our data and filename.


import qrcode

data = input("Enter the text or URL: ").strip()
filename = input("Enter the filename: ").strip()

IN the qr code module -> qrcode
create a QRCode object
and set box_size to 10 and border to 4.
These are just arbitrary values. And of course store in a var like qr.

Next call data and pass data |  qr.add_data(data).
Next fill the arguments for the image
qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")
(Arguments are the fill color and back color)
